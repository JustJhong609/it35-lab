# IT 35 - Application Development Project

This repository is part of my academic journey in studying Information Technology. It contains the source code and resources for our subject **Application Development** (IT 35), where we explore building cross-platform applications using **Ionic React** integrated with **Supabase**.

## 📱 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build a full-stack mobile/web app using **Ionic React** for the frontend and **Supabase** for the backend services such as authentication, real-time database, and more. It includes user registration, login, data storage, and secure password handling using `bcryptjs`.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Ionic React** – Cross-platform UI toolkit
- **Supabase** – Backend-as-a-Service (auth, database, storage)
- **Vite** – Fast dev environment
- **bcryptjs** – Password hashing library for client-side encryption

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js and npm
- Ionic CLI
- A Supabase account and project

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JustJhong609/it-35.git
   cd it-35
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
3. Install Supabase client and bycrypts
   ```bash
   npm install @supabase/supabase-js
   npm install bcryptjs
4. Create a .env file (or set your environment variables)
   ```ini
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
6. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev / ionic serve
Make sure you have your own Supabase project and environment variables set up to connect the frontend to the backend.
